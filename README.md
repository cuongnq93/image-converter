## Architecture

This application is built following SOLID principles and implements several design patterns for maintainability and extensibility.

### Design Patterns

#### 1. Strategy Pattern
Each image format has its own conversion strategy implementing the `IConversionStrategy` interface:

```typescript
// app/interfaces/conversion-strategy.interface.ts
export interface IConversionStrategy {
  readonly targetFormat: ImageFormat;
  convert(imageData: ImageBitmap, quality: number, optimize: boolean): Promise<Blob>;
  supports(format: ImageFormat): boolean;
  getRecommendedQuality(): number;
}
```

**Implementations**:
- `JpegConversionStrategy` - Optimized for photographs
- `PngConversionStrategy` - Lossless compression with transparency
- `WebpConversionStrategy` - Modern format with superior compression
- `AvifConversionStrategy` - Next-gen format with best compression
- `GifConversionStrategy` - Legacy format support
- `BmpConversionStrategy` - Uncompressed format support

#### 2. Factory Pattern
The `ConversionStrategyFactory` creates appropriate strategies based on target format:

```typescript
// app/factories/conversion-strategy.factory.ts
export class ConversionStrategyFactory {
  static getStrategy(format: ImageFormat): IConversionStrategy {
    // Returns the appropriate strategy for the format
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Centralized strategy creation
- Easy to add new formats
- Type-safe format handling

#### 3. Service Layer Pattern
Business logic is encapsulated in service classes:

- **ImageProcessorService**: Coordinates image processing operations
- **ImageOptimizerService**: Handles psychovisual optimization

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle
Each class has one reason to change:
- Strategies handle format-specific conversion
- Services coordinate business logic
- Components handle UI rendering

#### Open/Closed Principle
The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New formats can be added by creating new strategies
- No need to modify existing code

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
All strategies are interchangeable:
```typescript
const strategy: IConversionStrategy = ConversionStrategyFactory.getStrategy(format);
// Any strategy works the same way
```

#### Interface Segregation Principle
Focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies:
- `IConversionStrategy` - Format conversion
- `IImageProcessor` - Image processing
- `IImageOptimizer` - Optimization logic

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules depend on abstractions:
```typescript
export class ImageProcessorService implements IImageProcessor {
  constructor(private readonly optimizer?: IImageOptimizer) {}
}
```

## Image Optimization Techniques

### Psychovisual Optimization

The optimizer uses techniques based on human visual perception:

1. **Luminance vs Chrominance**: Humans are more sensitive to brightness than color
2. **High-Frequency Details**: Subtle reduction of high-frequency information
3. **Color Quantization**: Minimal reduction in color precision
4. **Adaptive Quality**: Quality adjusted based on image complexity

### Format-Specific Optimizations

#### JPEG
- Composite transparency on white background
- Optimal quality setting of 0.85 (sweet spot for photos)

#### PNG
- Lossless compression
- Color depth reduction for better compression
- Preserves transparency

#### WebP
- Modern compression algorithm
- Supports both lossy and lossless
- Quality of 0.90 for excellent results

#### AVIF

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why These Design Patterns?

#### Strategy Pattern
Perfect for format conversion because:
- Each format has unique characteristics
- Easy to add new formats without touching existing code
- Testing is simplified (test each strategy independently)
- Clear separation of concerns

#### Factory Pattern
Ideal for strategy creation because:
- Centralizes object creation logic
- Provides type safety
- Makes it easy to extend with new formats
- Simplifies client code

#### Service Layer
Separates business logic from UI:
- Makes testing easier (mock services)
- Business logic can be reused
- Clear API boundaries
- Easier to maintain and refactor

### Psychovisual Optimization Explained

Human eyes perceive images differently than cameras capture them. We exploit these perceptual limitations:

1. **YCbCr Color Space**: Separating luminance from chrominance
2. **Reduced Chrominance Precision**: Eyes less sensitive to color details
3. **Complexity Analysis**: Higher quality for detailed images
4. **Edge Detection**: Preserve important visual features

This results in 30-60% smaller files with imperceptible quality loss.

## Deployment Notes

### Cloudflare Workers

This application runs on Cloudflare's edge network:
- **Global CDN**: Served from 200+ locations worldwide
- **Zero Cold Starts**: Instant response times
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles any traffic level
- **Built-in DDoS Protection**: Enterprise-grade security

### Environment Setup

No environment variables needed for basic functionality. All processing happens client-side.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Horizontal Scroll on Mobile
- **Solution**: The app includes `overflow-x: hidden` on body and all containers
- If still occurring, check for elements with fixed widths exceeding viewport

#### Image Dimensions Showing as 0×0
- **Cause**: ImageBitmap closed before accessing dimensions
- **Solution**: Dimensions are now saved before blob conversion
- Implemented in `image-processor.service.ts`

#### AVIF Not Working
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support AVIF format
- **Solution**: Use feature detection or choose WebP/JPEG fallback
- Chrome 85+, Firefox 93+, Safari 16.1+ support AVIF

#### Slider Handle Overflows
- **Cause**: Percentage positioning with transforms
- **Solution**: Wrapper has `overflow-hidden` and proper pointer events

### Performance Tips

1. **Large Images**: Images over 10MB may take longer to process
2. **Mobile Devices**: Consider using lower quality settings on mobile for faster processing
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Use modern browsers for best performance and format support
4. **Memory**: Close other tabs if processing very large images

## Known Limitations

- **Maximum File Size**: Browser memory limitations may affect very large images (>50MB)
- **Format Support**: AVIF requires modern browser versions
- **Processing Speed**: Complex operations run on main thread (no Web Workers yet)
- **Batch Processing**: Currently supports single image conversion only
